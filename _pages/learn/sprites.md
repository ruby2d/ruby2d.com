Sprites are special images that can be used to create animations, kind of like a [flip book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_book). To create a sprite animation, first you'll need an image which contains each frame of your animation. Let's start with a simple example.

Take this sprite sheet of a coin rotating:

<img class="sprite-sheet" src="/assets/img/learn/coin.png">

Each frame is 84 pixels wide, so that's what we'll set as our clipping width. The clipping height will automatically be set as the image height. Let's also have the coin animation advance to the next frame at 300 milliseconds and loop when it gets to the end. Our coin should look like it's continuously rotating in a smooth animation. Here's how we'll create the sprite in Ruby:

```ruby
coin = Sprite.new(
  'coin.png',
  clip_width: 84,
  time: 300,
  loop: true
)
```

We can then play the sprite animation by using the `play` method:

```ruby
coin.play
```

Here's what our animation looks like:

<video width="140" class="sprite-video" src="/assets/img/learn/coin.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

Just like regular images, you can also set the `x` and `y` position of the sprite, along with its `width`, `height`, and `color`. To stop the sprite playing in this example, simply call `coin.stop`.

Some sprite sheets are meant to be played once, like an explosion. Take this sprite image:

<img class="sprite-sheet" src="/assets/img/learn/boom.png">

To play this through, we'll set the clip width to be 127 pixels and the frames to advance every 75 milliseconds.

```ruby
boom = Sprite.new(
  'boom.png',
  clip_width: 127,
  time: 75
)
```

Let's play this animation, but also print a message when it's done:

```ruby
boom.play do
  puts "Animation finished!"
end
```

Here's what our animation looks like:

<video width="154" class="sprite-video" src="/assets/img/learn/boom.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

So far, we've only focused on a single animation, but what if we want to have many in a single sprite sheet? A perfect example might be a hero character in our game, where the sprite sheet image might look like this:

<img class="sprite-sheet" src="/assets/img/learn/hero.png">

The sheet has seven images of the character in four different poses: standing, walking, climbing, and cheering. When creating a new instance from the `Sprite` class, we can use the `animation` attribute to set multiple animations. Each animation needs a name and a frame range, using Ruby's `..` range operator. Let's see what this would look like.

```ruby
hero = Sprite.new(
  'hero.png',
  width: 78,
  height: 99,
  clip_width: 78,
  time: 250,
  animations: {
    walk: 1..2,
    climb: 3..4,
    cheer: 5..6
  }
)
```

We could combine this with [input](/learn/input) events to animate the sprite with arrow keys:

```ruby
on :key_down do |event|
  case event.key
    when 'left'
      hero.play animation: :walk, loop: true, flip: :horizontal
    when 'right'
      hero.play animation: :walk, loop: true
    when 'up'
      hero.play animation: :climb, loop: true
    when 'down'
      hero.play animation: :climb, loop: true, flip: :vertical
    when 'c'
      hero.play animation: :cheer
  end
end
```

Here's what each animation looks like:

<video width="150" class="sprite-video" src="/assets/img/learn/hero.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

In the most complex case, we may want to specify a _different_ clipping rectangle for every frame. Instead of an animation frame range, we provide an array containing the size of the clipping rectangle and the time in milliseconds it should be displayed. Take this sprite atlas with numbers of different sizes scattered about:

<img class="sprite-sheet" src="/assets/img/learn/atlas.png">

We can "cut out" each number like so:


```ruby
atlas = Sprite.new(
  'atlas.png',
  animations: {
    count: [
      {
        x: 0, y: 0,
        width: 35, height: 41,
        time: 300
      },
      {
        x: 26, y: 46,
        width: 35, height: 38,
        time: 400
      },
      {
        x: 65, y: 10,
        width: 32, height: 41,
        time: 500
      },
      {
        x: 10, y: 99,
        width: 32, height: 38,
        time: 600
      },
      {
        x: 74, y: 80,
        width: 32, height: 38,
        time: 700
      }
    ]
  }
)
```

Then play the `:count` animation on a loop like so:

```ruby
atlas.play animation: :count, loop: true
```

Here's what the animation looks like:

<video width="100" class="sprite-video" src="/assets/img/learn/atlas.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>
