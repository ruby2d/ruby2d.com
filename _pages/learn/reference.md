In this documentation, `x` is the x-coordinate and `y` is the y-coordinate. When required to distinguish between multiple pairs of `x` and `y` coordinates, they will be numbered, for example: `x1`, `y1` or `x2`, `y2`.

# Window

In Ruby 2D, the user doesn't directly interact with the `Window` class, but rather through a [domain-specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domain-specific_language) (DSL) that is created when the library is required:

```ruby
require 'ruby2d'

# DSL is now available
```

DSL methods can now be used, which will handle all window management.

## DSL methods

| Method                | Used to... |
|-----------------------|------------|
| `set(<attributes>)`   | Set a window attribute. |
| `get(<attribute>)`    | Retrieve a window attribute. |
| `on(<event>,<block>)` | Specify a block to be called for a particular event. |
| `update(<block>)`     | Specify a block to be called every loop, or frame, of the window. |
| `clear`               | Clear all drawable objects in the window. |
| `show`                | Show the window. |
| `close`               | Close the window. |

## Setting attributes

Window attributes can be set by calling the DSL method `set` and passing a `Hash` containing one or multiple pairs of attributes `Symbol` keys and an acceptable value.

```ruby
set <attribute_symbol_name>: <value>
```

### Examples

```ruby
set title: "My Game"

set background: 'red'

set width: 800, height: 600
```

### Settable attributes

These are all the window attributes that can be set.

| Attribute          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `:title`           | The title of the window. Default: `"Ruby 2D"` |
| `:background`      | The background color of the window. Any valid Ruby 2D `Color` is acceptable. Default: `"black"` |
| `:width`           | The width of the window in pixels. Default: `640` |
| `:height`          | The height of the window in pixels. Default: `480` |
| `:viewport_width`  | The width of the viewport in pixels, the visible part of the window. Default is the width of the window at the time `show` is called. |
| `:viewport_height` | Same as `:viewport_width` above, but for setting the height. |
| `:resizable`       | Determines if the window can be resized, either `true` or `false`. Default: `false` |
| `:borderless`      | Determines if the window has a border, either `true` or `false`. Default: `false` |
| `:fullscreen`      | Determines if the window will be shown in fullscreen mode, either `true` or `false`. Default: `false` |
| `:diagnostics`     | Prints debugging information to the console, either `true` or `false`. This is mostly useful when working on Ruby 2D itself. Default: `false` |

## Getting attributes

The value of all attributes that can be `set` can also be retrieved using `get`. Unlike the `set` method, only one attribute value per `get` can be retrieved.

There are also a few extra attributes that can be retrieved through `get`:

| Attribute  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `:window`  | The window object itself, just in case you want to `inspect` it. |
| `:frames`  | The number of frames that have been rendered since the start. |
| `:fps`     | The current frame rate expressed in frames per second (a `Float`). |
| `:mouse_x` | The x-coordinate position of the mouse, relative to the window. |
| `:mouse_y` | The y-coordinate position of the mouse, relative to the window. |

### Examples

```ruby
get :title
puts(get :background)

# Set position of a square equal to the mouse
s = Square.new
s.x, s.y = get(:mouse_x), get(:mouse_y)
```

# Color

`Ruby2D::Color`

A color can be either a keyword ([based on CSS](http://clrs.cc)), a hexadecimal value, or an array containing a collection of red, green, blue, and alpha values expressed as a `Float` from `0.0` to `1.0`.

## Constructor

```ruby
Color.new

Color.new(<keyword>)

Color.new(<hex>)

Color.new([r, g, b, a])
# Where...
#   `r` is red
#   `g` is green
#   `b` is blue
#   `a` is the alpha channel, which affects opacity
```

## Accessors

`r`, `g`, `b`, `a` color values can be read.

## Examples

```ruby
Color.new('red')
Color.new('#ff0000')  # also red

# Red, fully opaque
Color.new([1, 0, 0, 1])

# Equivalent to above, a mixture of integers and floats
Color.new([1.0, 0, 0, 0.0])

# Red, fully transparent
Color.new([1, 0, 0, 0])  

# Red, half transparent
Color.new([0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5])

# Coloring a shape, all the same red square
Square.new(color: 'red')
Square.new(color: [1, 0, 0, 1])
Square.new(color: '#ff0000')
```
